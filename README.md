# libgithub: a JavaScript library for displaying GitHub data

libgithub uses the [GitHub API](http://develop.github.com/) to display
interesting activity from your [GitHub](http://github.com) account. The
libgithub library can create commit badges and activity lines to show live data
about your projects on GitHub on your websites and blogs.
